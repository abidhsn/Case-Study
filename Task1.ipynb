    "I would approach this problem by defining the functional as well as non-functional requirements. \n",
    "Within functional requirements we have to define APIs. Non-functional requirements that need to be defined include scalability, maintainability and testability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to design a notification service that at the minimum will support the following three core APIs: topic creation, publish message to a topic and subscribe to a topic. The first one ensures that a named resource is created where messages are sent; topics act as a storage repo for messages from a publisher, the second one allows for messages to be sent to topics and the third one allows for messages to be sent to subscribers; every subsciber for a topic receives a copy of a message from the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Defining non-functional requirements is another critical aspect of the problem. We may want to have a notification application that supports a large number of topics, subscribers and publishers. This is scalability. We will also want the application to be highly performant so that subscribers receive messages in a timely fashion. The system should, in addition, be able to survive network failures. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can roughly define a high-level architecture for the application but it is still a challenge to specify which technologies to use. In general the following components will be essential: a frontend service, a metadata database, metadatabase service, a temporary storage database for messages, a sender."
